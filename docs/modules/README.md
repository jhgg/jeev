## Writing Jeev Modules

Jeev exposes a really simple module interface. Every module can be defined as a single python file inside of a python package, or as an __init__ file inside of a python package.

### Getting Started 

Writing your first module? Check out [Your First Module](your_first_module.md), or check out the [API Documentation](api.md).

Writing web endpoints? Check out [Web Endpoints](web_endpoints.md). 

### Module Conventions and Practices
COMING SOON.

### Publishing your modules

Simply throw them up on pypi, and then people can install, then import and use your modules in their Jeevs. More examples on this coming soon.
